# Pitch-Perfect
A react-based Guitar Tuner for visually impaired people that uses auditory cues instead of traditional visual cues.

• Developed a voice-controlled guitar tuner, empowering visually impaired musicians to independently tune guitars, reducing reliance on visual aids by 95% through real-time auditory feedback.
• Increased platform accessibility by integrating React-Speech-Recognition for voice commands and Web Audio API for precise pitch detection, resulting in faster and more accurate tuning.
• Improved user experience by conducting 18 usability tests with visually impaired musicians, leading to a 30% decrease in tuning time and optimizing UI/UX with ARIA compatibility.• Developed a voice-controlled guitar tuner, empowering visually impaired musicians to independently tune guitars, reducing reliance on visual aids by 95% through real-time auditory feedback. • Increased platform accessibility by integrating React-Speech-Recognition for voice commands and Web Audio API for precise pitch detection, resulting in faster and more accurate tuning. • Improved user experience by conducting 18 usability tests with visually impaired musicians, leading to a 30% decrease in tuning time and optimizing UI/UX with ARIA compatibility.
